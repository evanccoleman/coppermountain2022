-Each file contains a separate topic area of references

-Google Scholar bibtex naming conventions are preferred for the sake of consistency
	-(FIRST AUTHOR LASTNAME)[FOUR DIGIT YEAR](ONE DESCRIPTIVE WORD NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE TITLE)
		-Ex: coleman2016comparison
	-When possible (and if no strong personal preference prevails) the Google Scholar index will be used directly

-The *.bib references are kept in chronological order
	-If multiple papers are present from the same year, papers are alphabetized by the BibTeX citation
		-Practically, this will be by the last name of the first author
	-Caveat: all self citations are listed purely chronologically, since the detailed chronology is known

-Full names should be used for authors inside of the *.bib files
